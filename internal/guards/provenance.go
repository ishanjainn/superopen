// Provenance: how came to know a thing, recorded alongside the thing itself.
//
// collects from runtimes over four different mechanisms whose fidelity differs by roughly
// an order of magnitude. A Claude Code `PermissionRequest` hook hands a typed payload that
// names the operation. A Codex OTLP log record hands it a body string that has to classify
// by substring match, with a catch-all that lands on `tool.invoked` when nothing matches. Both
// produced an `event.action` in the same field, and until these two markers existed nothing in the
// event distinguished them -- so every rule in rules/, every SIEM query, and every dashboard
// treated a reported fact and a keyword guess as the same claim.
//
// Two independent axes, hence two fields rather than one:
//
// - harness.collection_method is about the pipe: which mechanism carried this event off the
// runtime. Stable for the lifetime of an install, useful for "what is my coverage" questions.
// - event.fidelity is about the specific claim: did the source name this action, or did
// derive it. Varies event to event within one collection method, because an OTLP stream
// carries both records that declare `event.name` and records that carry only prose.
//
// Neither field is required. An event emits about itself (a health heartbeat, a self-update
// result) has no collecting harness and no source action to be faithful to, and leaves both empty
// rather than asserting a method it did not use.

// CollectionMethodForPlatform maps a `so --platform` value onto the mechanism that

//
// It lives here, beside NormalizeHarnessName, for the same reason that function does: the hook
// adapter writes this field from its `--platform` flag and no other code path can see that flag,
// so a mapping kept anywhere else would be a second definition waiting to disagree. Keying on
// `--platform` rather than on the normalized harness name is deliberate -- the flag records which
// integration shape installed, which is exactly the question, while the harness name
// records which product it was, which is not. VS Code is the case that separates them: hook and
// OTLP telemetry for it normalize to the same `vscode_copilot` harness, but only one of the two
// arrives through a hook.
//
// Platforms that use a -managed plugin or extension file are enumerated rather than
// defaulted, because the default has to be something and `hook` is the safer wrong answer: a
// plugin platform reported as `hook` overstates vendor support, while a hook platform reported as
// `plugin` would send someone to fix the source for a payload the vendor never sent. New
// plugin-shaped integrations belong in the list; new hook-shaped ones need no change.
