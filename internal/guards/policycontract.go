// Wire contract between a hook and an external provider.
// hook (the asker) and an external policy provider (the decider).
//
// The provider is an executable named by the SO_GUARD_PROVIDER environment
// variable. Before a hook allows a tool call, it writes a single JSON Request to
// the provider's stdin and reads a single JSON Response from stdout. The provider
// decides allow vs deny; the hook only asks and honors.
//
// The seam is inert when no provider is configured, and fail-open on any error
// (missing provider, timeout, non-zero exit, malformed output) — so the open
// build ships no enforcement behavior of its own. Both audit and enforce
// behavior live entirely in whatever provider an operator chooses to install.
//
// This package contains only data types: it is safe to import from any module
// (the hooks, the public CLI, or a third-party provider) without pulling in
// runtime behavior.
