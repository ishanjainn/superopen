// SortEvents puts a raw event stream into the order the events actually happened, in
// place, so correlation stops inheriting the order the lines happened to land in the log.
//
// Append order is not emission order. The hook adapter writes synchronously the moment a
// tool call is intercepted, while the collector exporter writes on its export interval,
// so a hook event for 10:00:01 routinely lands in the file after a collector event for
// 10:00:06. The rules engine evaluates an ordered sequence, which makes putting the stream in order the caller's job:
// every ordered-window rule silently misses when it is handed append order instead.
//
// The key is (timestamp, sequence, input position):
//
// - Timestamp first, because it is the only field both writers stamp from the same
// clock and is therefore the one thing comparable across capture paths.
// - Sequence second, but only when both events carry one, since it orders a single
// writer's stream rather than the log as a whole (see Event.Sequence).
// It is what separates a batch of metric datapoints that all carry one export's
// collection instant.
// - Input position last, so the result is a total order and one log always sorts one
// way, rather than depending on the sort implementation.
//
// An event whose timestamp is absent or unparseable inherits the last timestamp seen
// before it. That keeps it beside the events it arrived with instead of collapsing every
// such event to the epoch and dragging it to the front of the session.
