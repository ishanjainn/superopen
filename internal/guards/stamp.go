// fractional second, so the same clock renders at three different widths depending on the
// value it happens to land on ("...:05Z", "...:05.5Z", "...:05.000000001Z"). Fixed width
// keeps every event the same shape, which is what makes a byte-wise comparison of two
// UTC event timestamps agree with their chronological order -- something SIEM queries,
// `sort` over a JSONL tail, and human eyes on a log all end up relying on.
