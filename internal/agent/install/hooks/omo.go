// Senpi is the standalone edition of oh-my-openagent (OMO): an in-flight fork of pi-mono
// (code-yeongyu/senpi) that OMO brands and bundles its own extension into, distributed as the
// `omo` command. It is integrated the same shape as Pi and Prime Agent, which it shares an
// extension API with: no hooks configuration file to merge into and no OpenTelemetry export, so
// the TypeScript extension API is the only observation surface. Superopen writes one extension file
// that forwards runtime events to the `so` binary, and managedExtension handles it
// exactly as it handles Pi's, Oh My Pi's and Prime Agent's.
//
// The extension file is a separate source from the other three rather than the same file installed
// twice. It carries its own debug variable, its own test-sender symbol and its own comments about
// which of Senpi's events exist, and -- more to the point -- its own marker, so an install of one
// runtime is never mistaken for an install of another.

	// OmoManagedExtensionMarker identifies an extension file as one Superopen wrote for Senpi.
	//
	// Distinct from PiManagedExtensionMarker, OmpManagedExtensionMarker and
	// PrimeManagedExtensionMarker on purpose. The four runtimes install to different directories
	// today, but a shared marker would mean a status or repair pass could not tell which runtime's
	// extension it had found if any of them ever moved -- and an uninstall keyed on the wrong
	// marker removes the wrong file. Exported for the same three-package reason Pi's is: `hooks`
	// writes it, `harness` reads it to report telemetry status, and `inventory` reads it to decide
	// whether a file it found is Superopen-managed.
	//
	// The version suffix is part of the contract with the extension source. Bump it when the
	// extension's behavior changes in a way that makes an older installed copy wrong, which is
	// what lets a repair recognize a stale file rather than leave it in place.

	// omoConfigDirName is the config directory OMO's Senpi engine keeps, at both scopes.
	//
	// Two path segments rather than one, and that is the runtime's own shape rather than a
	// convenience here, exactly as it is for Prime Agent: this brand's CONFIG_DIR_NAME is ".omo",
	// its config layout is not flat, and its own directory resolver
	// (findNearestParentConfigDir(cwd, homeDir, ".omo", "agent")) joins the "agent" segment under
	// the working directory just as it does under the home directory. So its project scope has the
	// `agent` segment that Pi's and Oh My Pi's project scopes do not. Copying either of those
	// layouts would write the file where Senpi does not look -- and the install would report
	// success and collect nothing.
	//
	// Unlike Prime Agent, Superopen's installer does not replicate the runtime's own upward parent-
	// directory search: Senpi walks from the working directory toward home looking for an existing
	// `.omo/agent`, falling back to `~/.omo/agent` only when none is found. The project-level
	// install here always targets `<cwd>/.omo/agent`, matching the convention every other pi-family
	// installer in this package uses -- an install run from the same directory the operator later
	// runs `omo` from still lands exactly where the runtime looks.
	omoConfigDirName = ".omo/agent"

	// omoAgentDirEnv replaces the user-level agent directory outright.
	//
	// Senpi's own package.json brands this build's envPrefix as OMO, so the shipped `omo` binary
	// reads OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR first. Its brand profile also keeps two legacy prefixes readable
	// -- SENPI (the upstream engine's own name) and PI (pi-mono's) -- checked in that order when
	// the OMO-prefixed variable is unset, so Superopen's install lands where the runtime actually
	// looks even for an operator who set one of those before OMO existed. PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR is
	// deliberately not read ahead of SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR: that is the runtime's own declared
