// Prime Agent (Prime Intellect) is integrated the same shape as Pi, which it forked: no hooks
// configuration file to merge into and no OpenTelemetry export, so the TypeScript extension API is
// the only observation surface. Superopen writes one extension file that forwards runtime events to
// the `so` binary, and managedExtension handles it exactly as it handles Pi's and Oh My
// Pi's.
//
// The extension file is a separate source from Pi's rather than the same file installed twice.
// Prime Agent carries its own debug variable, its own test-sender symbol and its own comments about
// which of its events exist, and -- more to the point -- its own marker, so an install of one is
// never mistaken for an install of another.

	// PrimeManagedExtensionMarker identifies an extension file as one Superopen wrote for Prime Agent.
	//
	// Distinct from PiManagedExtensionMarker and OmpManagedExtensionMarker on purpose. The three
	// runtimes install to different directories today, but a shared marker would mean a status or
	// repair pass could not tell which runtime's extension it had found if any of them ever moved
	// -- and an uninstall keyed on the wrong marker removes the wrong file. Exported for the same
	// three-package reason Pi's is: `hooks` writes it, `harness` reads it to report telemetry
	// status, and `inventory` reads it to decide whether a file it found is Superopen-managed.
	//
	// The version suffix is part of the contract with the extension source. Bump it when the
	// extension's behavior changes in a way that makes an older installed copy wrong, which is what
	// lets a repair recognize a stale file rather than leave it in place.

	// Two path segments rather than one, and that is the runtime's own shape rather than a
	// convenience here: its CONFIG_DIR_NAME is the literal ".prime/agent", and it joins that whole
	// string under the home directory *and* under the working directory. So its project scope has
	// the `agent` segment that Pi's and Oh My Pi's project scopes do not. Copying either of those
	// layouts would write the file where Prime Agent does not look -- and the install would report
	// success and collect nothing.
	primeConfigDirName = ".prime/agent"

	// primeAgentDirEnv replaces the user-level agent directory outright.
	//
	// The name is derived rather than fixed upstream: Prime Agent builds it from the `piConfig.name`
	// in its own package.json, which is "prime-agent", so the shipped build reads
	// PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR. PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR is what the same code produces for upstream
	// Pi and for Oh My Pi, and is deliberately not honored here: reading another product's variable
	// would move this install whenever an operator had set it for that one.
