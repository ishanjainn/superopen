// Editing `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`, which is the user's file and not Superopen's.
//
// Every other runtime Superopen installs into either gives it a file of its own or gives it a JSON
// document, where "read, change one key, write" loses nothing. This is neither. The patch layer is
// YAML a person writes by hand: it carries their comments, their quoting, and `!!js` expressions
// the loader evaluates at boot. Decoding it into Go structs and re-encoding would silently discard
// all three -- the comments explaining why a row exists, and the tag that makes an expression an
// expression rather than the string "Number(process.env.DSH_PORT ?? 3081)".
//
// So the document is edited as a document: parsed into a yaml.Node tree, one element appended to or
// removed from the top-level sequence, re-encoded from the same tree. yaml.v3 carries comments,
// scalar style and custom tags through that round trip, which is what makes touching a live user
// file defensible rather than merely convenient. A test pins it, because it is a property of the
// library rather than of this code and a library change would take a user's boot configuration with
// it.
//
// What Superopen appends is one self-contained element:
//
//	- insert:
//	    - id: superopen-endpoint-hooks
//	      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-hooks-claude-code'
//	      config:
//	        configPath: /home/you/.dsh/superopen-endpoint-hooks.json
//
// Self-contained rather than a row pushed into somebody else's existing `insert:` list, for two
// reasons. An uninstall can then remove exactly what an install added, by dropping one element,
// rather than reaching into a list whose other rows it must leave untouched and whose emptiness it
// would then have to reason about. And the loader applies patch elements in order, so an element of
// Superopen's own cannot change when another row's position changes.
//
// The path in `configPath` is absolute, and that is required rather than tidy: the bridge resolves
// a relative config path against the directory the process was launched from, which for an agent
// runtime is wherever the user happened to be standing.
