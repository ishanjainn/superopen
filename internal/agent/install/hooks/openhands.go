// OpenHands registers hooks in one file, `.openhands/hooks.json`, which the runtime reads directly
// and which is also where a user keeps their own hooks. Superopen is a guest in it, so it merges its
// commands in and leaves everything else byte for byte -- unlike Muse Code, where Superopen owns a
// file outright because the runtime gave it one to own.
//
// The file is stricter than it looks, and every rule below is a rule the runtime enforces by
// silently dropping hooks rather than by reporting an error:
//
//   - Its top level is the event map itself. HookConfig forbids extra fields, so one unrecognized
//     top-level key fails validation and the whole file loads as nothing -- which rules out the
//     marker key Superopen stamps on the files it owns elsewhere. Detection is by the hook command
//     instead, which is the same thing every settings-file runtime already does.
//
//   - A legacy wrapper form, `{"hooks": {...}}`, is also accepted, and the loader unwraps it by
//     replacing the whole document with what is under that key. So adding a top-level event
//     alongside an existing `hooks` wrapper does not merge -- it discards Superopen's hooks with a
//     log line nobody sees. Superopen writes inside the wrapper when it finds one.
//
//   - Event names may be snake_case or Claude Code's PascalCase, and providing both spellings of
//     one event is a hard error that takes the entire file down, not just that event. So Superopen
//     writes under whichever spelling the file already uses for an event and never introduces a
//     second one.
//
// A file that already breaks one of these is refused rather than written into, because installing
// into it would report success and collect nothing.

const openHandsHookFileName = "hooks.json"

// openHandsHookName marks Superopen's hook definitions for a human reading the file.
//
// `name` is a documented HookDefinition field rather than an extra key, so it costs nothing and
// survives validation. It is deliberately not what uninstall and status match on: a user can edit
// it, and the command is what actually identifies a Superopen hook.

// OpenHands hook timeouts are seconds, and the runtime's own default is 60.
//
// Stated at the value for the reason the Qwen and Muse constants give: the same `timeout` field
// means milliseconds on Qwen and seconds here, and the two files look alike. Explicit values
// rather than the inherited default because 60 seconds is a long time to hold an agent turn for a
// telemetry hook that finishes in milliseconds -- these are ceilings on a hang, not budgets.
//
