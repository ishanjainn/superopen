// Qwen Code hook timeouts are milliseconds.
//
// This is the one place Qwen's settings format diverges from Claude Code's while looking identical,
// and it fails quietly in the direction that hurts. Claude Code reads `timeout` as seconds, so the
// values the Claude installer writes -- 30, 45, 10 -- mean 30ms, 45ms and 10ms to Qwen. A hook
// process cannot start, read stdin, resolve a git branch and append to a JSONL file in ten
// milliseconds, so every tool event would be killed mid-write. The install would report success,
// the settings file would look right, and the runtime log would be empty or truncated.
//
// Named constants rather than literals so the unit is stated at the value, and so
// TestQwenTimeoutsAreMillisecondsNotSeconds has something to assert against other than magic
// numbers. Qwen's own default is 60000 (60s); events with no entry here inherit it, which is the
// right answer for the ones that do no work beyond writing a line.

	qwenPromptSubmitTimeoutMS = 30000

)

// qwenAllToolsMatcher matches every tool id.
//
// Qwen documents `""` and `"*"` as the two spellings that match all events of a type, and uses
// `"*"` in its own examples. `"*"` is preferred over an omitted matcher because Qwen's matcher
// table marks tool events as regex-filtered and its tool-event examples always carry one; an
// omitted matcher on a tool event is undocumented territory, and "documented and demonstrated"
// beats "probably equivalent" for the field that decides whether a hook fires at all.
const qwenAllToolsMatcher = "*"

// qwenHookShell tells Qwen which shell to parse Superopen's hook command with.
//
// Superopen builds that command with hookCommandQuote, which single-quotes every path on every
// platform. Single quotes are fully literal in a POSIX shell, which is what a Windows path needs --
// inside double quotes bash still expands `$` and eats a doubled backslash, so a profile directory
// containing a `$` would vanish and a UNC path would lose a separator. That function's own comment
// records the cost of the choice: the same quoting is not valid in cmd.exe, and in PowerShell a
// quoted string in command position is an expression rather than a command.
//
// Qwen is the runtime that comment anticipated. It runs hook commands through a shell of its
// choosing and documents exactly two values a hook may ask for, `bash` and `powershell`. Unlike
// Claude Code, which was measured to run hook commands through Git Bash on Windows regardless,
// Qwen only uses bash when the hook configuration asks for it. Left unset on Windows, a
// Node-hosted runtime lands on the platform default -- cmd.exe -- where
// Superopen's quotes are literal characters and every hook fails to start while the install still
// reports success. That is the same silent-failure shape as writing a seconds-valued timeout, and
// it is worth the same care.
//
// `bash` rather than `powershell` because the command is already POSIX-quoted: choosing the other
// would mean maintaining a second quoting dialect for one runtime. On macOS and Linux this names
// the shell that would have run anyway. On Windows it requires bash on PATH, which is the same
// requirement Claude Code already carries there -- and it strictly improves on the alternative,
// since cmd.exe cannot parse the command at all.

// installQwenSettings merges Superopen's hooks into Qwen Code's settings.json.

// The file is shared with the user's own configuration -- model, theme, MCP servers, their own
// hooks -- so this goes through the same merge the Claude and Factory installers use: unrelated
// top-level keys are preserved verbatim, non-Superopen hooks in the same event group survive, and a
// re-install replaces Superopen's own entries instead of stacking a second copy beside them.
//
// The event set is everything Qwen exposes that carries endpoint signal. `PostToolUseFailure` is
// registered alongside `PostToolUse` because a failed tool is a separate event in Qwen and would
// otherwise be invisible; `PermissionRequest` is what makes an approval prompt observable at all.
// The fire-and-forget events Qwen also offers -- `MessageDisplay`, `StopFailure`, `PostCompact`,
// `SessionDelete`, the todo pair -- are deliberately not registered: `MessageDisplay` alone fires
// every ~200ms for the length of every reply, and spawning a process that often to record assistant
// text Superopen does not otherwise retain would cost more than it tells anyone.
