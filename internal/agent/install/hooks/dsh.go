// DeepSeek Harness is the one supported runtime where installing hooks takes two files, because
// the runtime does not read a hooks file until something tells it to.
//
// `dsh` runs Claude Code hooks through `@deepseek-ai/dsh-hooks-claude-code`, a bridge DeepSeek
// ships as a dependency of the CLI but does not mount. Nothing is loaded by convention: the
// harness composes itself from a plugin tree, and a plugin that is not in the tree does not exist.
// So Superopen writes
//
//  1. `$DSH_HOME/superopen-endpoint-hooks.json` -- a Claude Code hooks file Superopen owns outright, and
//  2. one row in `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml` mounting the bridge at that file.
//
// The second file is the interesting one and it is not Superopen's. It is the user's own tweak layer,
// applied over every profile, and it may already carry their rows, their comments and `!!js`
// expressions evaluated at boot. So it is edited as a document rather than rewritten: parsed into
// a yaml.Node, one element appended or removed, re-encoded. yaml.v3 preserves comments, quoting
// style and custom tags through that round trip, which is what makes editing a live user file
// defensible at all.
//
// Two properties of that file are load-bearing and neither is obvious:
//
//   - An empty or comments-only patch file FAILS BOOT. It is not ignored and it is not a warning:
//     `dsh` refuses to start. So an uninstall that removes Superopen's last row must remove the file,
//     not truncate it -- an absent patch layer is fine, an empty one is not.
//
//   - The home-level file outranks the per-profile one and applies to every profile. That is why
//     Superopen installs here rather than into `profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`: one install covers the
//     CLI, Web, ACP and SDK surfaces, which are four compositions of one harness rather than four
//     products.
//
// There is no project scope, and its absence is a property of the runtime rather than a decision
// here. The bridge's `configPath` is process-level -- read once at startup, resolved against the
// launch directory -- and the bridge's own source records per-session discovery of a project-local
// hooks file as unimplemented. There is nowhere for a repository to put one, so dshHooksPath
// refuses the level with that explanation instead of writing a file nothing would read.
//
// Superopen owns its filename in the first file and its row id in the second, and refuses rather than
// overwriting anything it did not write.

	// at. That is sound here rather than a compromise: the loader itself diffs entries by `id`, so
	// this string is load-bearing to the runtime and not a label a user would edit for cosmetic
	// reasons. The hook commands are still what `dshHasEndpointHooks` checks in the other file, so

# Superopen Endpoint

<!-- ` + dshSkillMarker + ` -->

Use this skill when the user asks about Superopen, endpoint telemetry, local traces, telemetry gaps,
or whether the current DeepSeek Harness session has been collected by Superopen.

Superopen is local-only endpoint telemetry. This skill does not publish or upload anything.

## Check Status

Run this first:

` + "```bash" + `
superopen endpoint dsh status --workspace "$PWD" --json
` + "```" + `

Summarize whether the current workspace has pending DeepSeek session records.

## Sync Current Workspace

When the user asks to collect, backfill, update, or refresh Superopen telemetry for the current
DeepSeek Harness session, run:

` + "```bash" + `
superopen endpoint dsh sync --workspace "$PWD"
` + "```" + `

Use ` + "`--print`" + ` only when the user wants to preview mapped events without writing Superopen's
runtime log.
`
