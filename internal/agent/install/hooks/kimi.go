// Kimi Code is the one supported runtime whose hook registration lives inside a file that also
// holds the user's API keys.
//
// There is one place to register: a `[[hooks]]` array of tables in `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`,
// which is the same file that carries `[providers.<name>].api_key`, the model catalog, the
// permission rules and whatever comments the user wrote around them. Kimi Code has no
// project-level configuration at all -- its own documentation says the CLI reads a single
// user-level config file, and the way to isolate a project is to point KIMI_CODE_HOME somewhere
// else -- so there is no repository-scoped install to offer.
//
// Two consequences shape everything below.
//
// The first is that Superopen never re-serializes this file. It appends its `[[hooks]]` entries to
// the end of the text and leaves every byte above them exactly as it found them, so a secret
// cannot be rewritten, re-quoted, reordered or dropped by a round trip through a parser -- and a
// comment the user wrote next to one cannot be lost. Appending is sound rather than merely
// convenient: an array-of-tables header at the end of a TOML document opens a new table and
// cannot change the meaning of anything before it, which is true of TOML 1.0 generally and
// verified here against the exact parser Kimi Code uses. Every write is parsed back and compared
// against what it was supposed to produce before it replaces the file, so a scanning mistake
// fails the install instead of corrupting a config.
//
// The second is that detection and removal go by the hook command rather than by the comment
// Superopen writes above its block, and that is not the usual caution -- there is a specific,
// reachable case. Kimi Code's legacy migration from `kimi-cli` merges the old home's settings
// into this file by serializing the merged result, which preserves the `[[hooks]]` entries and
// drops every comment in the document. A marker-based uninstall would silently fail to find its
// own block on any machine that had been through that upgrade. The comment is a label for a
// person reading the file, the same way OpenHands' `name` field is, and nothing matches on it.
//
// One shape is refused rather than written into: a `hooks` key written as an inline array
// (`hooks = [{...}]`). TOML forbids appending `[[hooks]]` after that, so the file would stop
// loading -- and on this runtime a config that does not parse is not a warning, it is a startup
// failure. The refusal names the shape and what to do about it.

	// reads.
	kimiEnvHome = "KIMI_CODE_HOME"

// kimiManagedComment labels Superopen's block for a person reading the file.
//
// Informational only. It is deliberately not what uninstall and status match on -- a user can
// edit it, and Kimi Code's own legacy migration rewrites this file in a way that drops every
// comment while keeping the hook entries. The command is what identifies a Superopen hook, which is
// what every other installer already does and what survives that rewrite.

// alike, and getting it wrong kills every hook mid-write while the install still reports success.
// Explicit values rather than the inherited default because these are ceilings on a hang, not
// budgets -- a telemetry hook finishes in milliseconds.
//
// Kimi Code validates the field as an integer in 1..600 and refuses to load the whole config file
// if it is outside that range, which is the other reason none of these is left implicit.
//
// The two long ones are long for a reason: the closing events flush cloud telemetry, which has a
// ten-second timeout of its own, and prompt submission can wait on the policy seam.

// kimiEvents are the events Superopen subscribes to, out of the twenty Kimi Code exposes.
//
// Thirteen of twenty, and what is left out is a decision rather than an oversight:
//
//   - `SessionHeartbeat` fires every sixty seconds for the lifetime of a session, and its timer
//     runs *only when a hook is configured for it* -- so subscribing would not observe an existing
//     behavior, it would create one: a process spawned every minute in every session, writing an
//     event that says nothing happened. That is the one event where the cost of watching exceeds
//     what is watched.
//   - `UserPromptQueued` fires when a message is typed while a turn is still running. The prompt
//     is recorded when it is submitted, which is what UserPromptSubmit is; recording the queueing
//     as well would count one prompt twice.
//   - `TurnStarted` carries a turn id the endpoint schema has no field for, and its `prompt` is
//     the same text UserPromptSubmit already carried.
//   - `TaskStarted` announces a background task, and the tool that started it -- a `Bash` with
//     run_in_background, an `Agent`, an `AskUserQuestion` -- has already been recorded as itself.
//   - `Notification` reports a background task changing state, which is the same activity again.
//   - `StopFailure` reports a turn that failed on an API or runtime error rather than anything the
//     agent did.
//   - `Interrupt` fires in place of Stop when the operator cancels a turn. Superopen's closing action
//     is `tool.completed`, which states that the agent finished; a cancelled turn did not, and
//     there is no action in the endpoint schema that says so. Recording it as a completion would
//     be worse than not recording it, and the session is still closed by SessionEnd.
//
// PostToolUseFailure shares a subcommand with PostToolUse, and PermissionResult shares one with
// PermissionRequest. Both pairs are one thing observed twice, and the mapper tells them apart from
// `hook_event_name`; splitting either across two subcommands would mean two readers that have to
// agree about what a failure or a decision is.

// Double quotes are what cmd.exe reads, and a Windows path cannot contain one -- `"` is an illegal

// rather than hidden: cmd.exe still expands `%VAR%` inside double quotes, so a Superopen install
