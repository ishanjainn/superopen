// OpenClaw Gateway is integrated as a Superopen-managed plugin, the Cline and Pi-family shape, with
// one structural difference: OpenClaw discovers a plugin as a *directory* rather than as a file.
//
// A plugin root is a directory holding `package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, and the entrypoint
// the first of those declares. OpenClaw scans the immediate children of its extensions directories
// and reads each child's manifests, so Superopen owns the directory `superopen-endpoint` rather than a
// filename inside a directory somebody else also writes to -- the goose arrangement, for the same
// reason.
//
// The gateway also collects over OTLP, through OpenClaw's own `diagnostics-otel` plugin and
// `superopen endpoint integrations openclaw`. The two paths are complementary rather than
// alternatives: OTLP carries gateway-level traces and metrics, and by OpenClaw's default carries
// no prompt, tool, or file content at all, while this path carries the agent's actual work.

// documentation, under either of two filenames, and JSON5 permits comments, trailing commas and
// unquoted keys -- none of which survive a round trip through a Go JSON encoder. Rewriting an
// operator's gateway config would silently strip their comments and reformat a file that
// configures every chat channel they run. A plugin directory Superopen owns outright is a footprint
// worth taking; their gateway config is not.
//
// So this reads the config and says what is missing, and `superopen endpoint hooks install` prints
// it. Two things can be missing:
//
//   - `plugins.entries.superopen-endpoint.hooks.allowConversationAccess`. OpenClaw requires every
//     non-bundled plugin to opt in explicitly before it will register a conversation hook, and
//     `llm_output` is one. Without it the plugin still collects sessions, prompts, tools,
//     commands, files and MCP activity, and collects no token usage and no agent messages. It is
//     advisory rather than fatal for that reason.
//   - `plugins.allow`. An operator using an allowlist has to name this plugin in it. Superopen only
//     mentions it when the key is already present: an allowlist introduced where none existed
//     would deny every other plugin the operator runs, which is a far worse outcome than the one
//     it would fix.
//
// A config that cannot be read or parsed produces no advice rather than a guess. JSON5 is the
// common case there, and telling an operator their config is missing a key that is in it -- three
