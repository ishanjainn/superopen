// Kiro registers hooks as standalone JSON files in a directory it scans -- `.kiro/hooks/` in a
// project, `~/.kiro/hooks/` globally -- rather than in one file everybody shares. That makes this
// the simplest installer of the set: Superopen writes one file of its own and never reads, rewrites
// or deletes anything a user put beside it.
//
// It is worth naming why that is different from the two neighbouring shapes. OpenHands hands
// Superopen a single hooks.json that is also where the user keeps theirs, so the installer there is a
// careful merge. Muse Code has a settings key naming one managed file, so Superopen owning that file
// means taking the only slot, and the installer refuses when somebody already holds it. Kiro has
// neither problem: every file in the directory is loaded, so an extra one is additive by
// construction and there is no slot to contend for.
//
// Two things about the emitted file are load-bearing and neither is obvious from the schema:
//
//   - No `matcher`. The field is documented as a regex, and what it matches depends on the
//     trigger: a tool name on PreToolUse/PostToolUse, the prompt text on UserPromptSubmit, nothing
//     at all on SessionStart and Stop. Omitting it means always-match, which is what a telemetry
//     hook wants on every one of those. Writing the `"*"` that reads as "all tools" in Kiro's IDE
//     tool-name field would be a different thing entirely here -- `*` is not a valid regex, so at
//     best it matches nothing and at worst it fails to compile and takes the hook with it.
//
//   - No top-level key but `version` and `hooks`. Those two are the whole documented schema, and
//     Superopen's marker goes on each hook's `name` and `description` instead, which are documented
//     hook fields. Detection does not rely on either: the hook command is what identifies a Superopen
//     hook, the same evidence every other runtime's detection uses, because a name is something a
//     user can edit.

	// kiroHookDirName is the directory Kiro scans, relative to the scope root.
	kiroHookDirName = "hooks"

	// kiroHookFileName is the file Superopen owns. Kebab-case and descriptive, which is what Kiro's
	// own guidance asks for; the name has no meaning to the loader, which takes every .json in the
	// directory.
	kiroHookFileName = "superopen-endpoint.json"

	// kiroSchemaVersion is the only value the `version` field accepts today. Written literally
	// rather than derived, because a file whose version Kiro does not recognize is not a file with
	// a warning -- it is hooks that never run.
	kiroSchemaVersion = "v1"

	// kiroHookName marks Superopen's hook definitions for a human reading the file. `name` is a
	// required field, so this costs nothing; it is deliberately not what detection matches on.

// Kiro hook timeouts are seconds, and the runtime's own default is 60.
//
// Stated at the value for the reason the Qwen, Muse and OpenHands constants give: the same
// `timeout` field means milliseconds on Qwen and seconds here, the files look alike, and getting
// it wrong kills every hook mid-write while the install still reports success. Explicit values
// rather than the inherited default because 60 seconds is a long time to hold an agent turn for a
// telemetry hook that finishes in milliseconds -- these are ceilings on a hang, not budgets.
//
// The two long ones are long for a reason: prompt submission can wait on the policy seam, and the
// closing event flushes cloud telemetry, which has a ten-second timeout of its own.
//
// Zero is deliberately never written. On Kiro `0` does not mean "the default", it means *no
// timeout at all* -- a hook that hung would hang the agent turn with it, indefinitely.

//
// Five of Kiro's eleven, and the six that are missing are missing on purpose:
//
//   - PostFileCreate, PostFileSave and PostFileDelete would duplicate PostToolUse rather than add
//     to it. Kiro's file triggers fire only for changes the agent made, and every change the agent
//     makes goes through a write tool -- so subscribing would record two events for one write,
//     with no way for a reader to tell they were the same action. The duplicate would also be the
//     poorer of the two: a file trigger offers the path through a `{{filePath}}` template, while
//     PostToolUse carries the path, the operation, the content and the result. Double-counting a
//     file change in a security log is worse than the coverage this leaves on the table, which is
//     none.
//
//   - PreTaskExec and PostTaskExec announce a spec task starting and finishing. They are real
//     signal with no duplicate, and they are left out because Kiro does not document what they put
//     on stdin: without a task id or a task name the event would say that some task began, which
//     is not something an investigator can act on. This is the one deliberate gap that a published
//     payload would close, and it is recorded in the runtime docs as such rather than left for
//     someone to rediscover.
//
//   - Manual is an operator running a hook by hand. There is nothing for Superopen to observe in it.
//
// SessionEnd has no entry because Kiro has no such trigger: Stop is the closing event, and it
// fires per turn rather than per session.
