//
// An argv array is passed straight to the OS with no shell in between, which sidesteps quoting
// entirely -- the same reason the Cline plugin uses one. Senpi runs as a Bun-compiled binary or
// under Node depending on how it was installed, and on Windows as readily as on macOS, so there is
// no one shell whose quoting rules would hold.

// Declared here rather than imported from @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent on purpose -- and Senpi
// really does publish under that name, because it is an in-flight fork of badlogic/pi-mono
// (code-yeongyu/senpi) that kept the upstream package name. The installed file sits in
// ~/.omo/agent/extensions with no node_modules beside it, and Senpi loads third-party extensions
// through Bun's own importer or jiti, neither of which resolves a type-only import. A value import
// would fail at load; a type import would resolve for nobody. Local structural types cost the
// compile-time link to Senpi's definitions and buy a file that loads wherever Senpi does.

// The events Superopen subscribes to, and nothing else.
//
// Senpi's ExtensionEvent union has more than thirty members: provider-request and response
// internals, streaming message and tool-execution updates, compaction, model-select, and TUI
// plumbing among them. Most describe how the runtime got its work done rather than what the agent
// did. Subscribing to all of them would fill the runtime log with rows no query asks for -- the
// same reason the Cline mapper drops unrecognized stages -- and would put Superopen in the path of
// every streaming token update.
//
// `tool_call` and `tool_result` are the pair that carries tool activity: the first names the tool
// and its arguments before it runs, the second carries the outcome. `user_bash` is a command the
// human ran with the `!` prefix, which no tool event covers. This is Pi's own set of seven exactly
// -- Senpi kept the shape (the same `type` discriminator, the same toolName/input/details tool
// events, the same assistant message parts, the same input/output/cacheRead/cacheWrite/cost usage
// object) even where it added events Pi does not have, such as `tool_execution_start` and
// `turn_start`/`turn_end`. Those additions describe execution progress and turn bookkeeping rather
// than a new kind of agent action tool_call/tool_result do not already cover, so they are left
// unsubscribed rather than adding a second, thinner tool-lifecycle signal beside the one Superopen
// already records for every Pi-family runtime.
//
// Deliberately absent: any approval event. Senpi's `tool_call` handler can block a call, but that
// is an extension deciding, not an operator being asked -- it exposes no operator approval decision
// through this API (its permission-system builtin owns that prompt and does not publish it as an
// extension event). Synthesizing an approval from a pre-tool notification would put a decision
// nobody made into the log, so Superopen records these as tool activity and leaves approval telemetry
// empty, exactly as it does for Pi and Prime Agent.
//
// Also absent, and not an omission: `user_python`. Oh My Pi added a `$` operator prefix that runs
// Python outside the agent loop and subscribes to its event; Senpi forked pi-mono separately and
// has no such prefix.
