// The argv Superopen's installer writes, as an array rather than a command line.
//
// An argv array is passed straight to the OS with no shell in between, which sidesteps quoting
// entirely -- the same reason the Cline plugin and the Pi-family extensions use one. OpenClaw runs
// as a long-lived gateway on macOS, Linux and Windows alike, so there is no single shell whose
// quoting rules would hold.

// A send that has not finished in this long is abandoned.
//

// observe hooks: `before_tool_call` never waits at all (see dispatch below).

// The hooks this plugin registers, and nothing else.
//
// OpenClaw publishes forty-one typed hooks. These ten are the ones that describe what the agent
// did; the rest describe how the gateway got its work done. The full reasoning for each exclusion
// lives beside supportedOpenClawHooks() in cli/so/cmd/openclaw_event.go, which is the
// mapper half of this contract -- a name that disagrees between the two files produces no
// telemetry rather than an error, so both sides pin the list and a test asserts they match.
//
// Three exclusions are worth repeating here, because they are about what this plugin is allowed to
// be rather than about payload volume. `before_prompt_build` and `agent_turn_prepare` are prompt
// *injection* hooks; `inbound_claim` and the claim-kind delivery hooks can swallow a message
// outright; and `skill_proposal_evaluate` makes its handler a voting evaluator on whether a skill
// may be installed. Superopen observes. Registering any of them would ask OpenClaw for a power Superopen
// must not hold, and would do so silently.

// The hooks whose handler must never make OpenClaw wait.
//
// `before_tool_call` is registered fail-closed by OpenClaw itself: its default failure policy for
// this hook is "fail-closed", so a handler that throws or exceeds its timeout *blocks the tool
// call*. Superopen telemetry must never be able to stop an agent from working, so this handler
// dispatches its send and returns synchronously, without awaiting and without a promise for
// OpenClaw to wait on. The gateway is a long-lived process, so an unawaited child still runs to
// completion.
//
// The cost is ordering: a `tool.invoked` row can land in the log after the `tool.completed` row
// for the same call. That is acceptable because ordering was never the join -- `gen_ai.tool.call.id`
// is, and both halves carry it.

//
// An entry is consumed by its own `after_tool_call`, so this bound only has to cover calls that
// never produce one -- an aborted run, a session torn down mid-tool, a gateway shutting down
// between the two halves. Those are reclaimed by oldest-first eviction here and by nothing else:
// no lifecycle hook clears this map, deliberately, because in a gateway every session boundary
// belongs to *one* of the conversations in flight and clearing on it would discard the others'
// live state. A gateway fans several conversations into one process, so this is set well above a
// single agent's working set and is still only a few kilobytes at worst.
const maxPendingToolCalls = 256

// rememberDerivedPaths records the destination paths OpenClaw derived for a proposed tool call,
// keyed by OpenClaw's own tool call id.
//
// This exists for one reason: `before_tool_call` carries `derivedPaths` and `after_tool_call` does
// not. `apply_patch` takes the whole patch envelope as a single string argument, so without those
// paths a completed patch is a tool call with a blob attached and no file rows at all -- and every
// file-scoped detection Superopen ships matches on `file.path`.
//
// The join is OpenClaw's own call id rather than a timestamp or a guess, and both halves fire in
// this same process, so remembering the value until the call completes is exact. That id is either
// the provider's own (`call_...`, `toolu_...`) or `openclaw-<randomUUID()>`, so it is unique across
// every conversation the gateway is serving and two sessions cannot collide on one entry.
