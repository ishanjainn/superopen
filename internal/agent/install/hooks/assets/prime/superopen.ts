// The argv Superopen's installer writes, as an array rather than a command line.

// An argv array is passed straight to the OS with no shell in between, which sidesteps quoting
// entirely -- the same reason the Cline plugin uses one. Prime Agent runs as a Bun-compiled binary
// or under Node depending on how it was installed, and on Windows as readily as on macOS, so there
// is no one shell whose quoting rules would hold.

// Declared here rather than imported from @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent on purpose -- and Prime
// Agent really does publish under that name, because it is a hard fork of pi-mono that kept the
// upstream package names. The installed file sits in ~/.prime/agent/extensions with no node_modules
// beside it, and Prime Agent loads it through jiti, which strips types without resolving them. A
// value import would fail at load; a type import would resolve for nobody. Local structural types
// cost the compile-time link to Prime Agent's definitions and buy a file that loads wherever Prime
// Agent does.

// The events Superopen subscribes to, and nothing else.
//
// Prime Agent publishes upwards of forty event types: provider request and response internals,
// streaming message updates, compaction, refinement and tree-navigation signals, resource discovery
// and TUI plumbing. Most describe how the runtime got its work done rather than what the agent did.
// Subscribing to all of them would fill the runtime log with rows no query asks for -- the same
// reason the Cline mapper drops unrecognized stages -- and would put Superopen in the path of every
// streaming token update.
//
// `tool_call` and `tool_result` are the pair that carries tool activity: the first names the tool
// and its arguments before it runs, the second carries the outcome. On this runtime that is nearly
// everything, because its only default tool is `ipython` -- a persistent Python kernel through
// which the agent reads files, writes files and runs shell commands via a `bash()` helper -- so a
// cell's code and the diffs its kernel streams are the agent's actions rather than a detail of one
// tool. `user_bash` is a command the human ran with the `!` prefix, which no tool event covers.
//
// Deliberately absent: any approval event. Prime Agent's `tool_call` handler can block a call, but
// that is an extension deciding, not an operator being asked -- it exposes no operator approval
// decision through this API. Synthesizing an approval from a pre-tool notification would put a
// decision nobody made into the log, so Superopen records these as tool activity and leaves approval
// telemetry empty, exactly as it does for Pi and Cline.
//
// Also absent, and not an omission: `user_python`. Oh My Pi added a `$` operator prefix that runs
// Python outside the agent loop and subscribes to its event; Prime Agent forked pi-mono separately
// and has no such prefix. Its operator surface is `!` alone.
