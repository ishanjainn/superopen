// Oh My Pi publishes upwards of thirty event types. Most are provider-request internals, streaming
// message updates, compaction and retry signals, and TUI plumbing -- they describe how the runtime
// got its work done rather than what the agent did. Subscribing to all of them would fill the
// runtime log with rows no investigation asks for and would put Superopen in the path of every
// streaming token update.
//
// `tool_call` and `tool_result` are the pair carrying tool activity: the first names the tool and
// its arguments before it runs, the second carries the outcome. `user_bash` and `user_python` are
// code the operator ran with Oh My Pi's `!` and `$` prefixes, which no tool event covers.
//
// `tool_approval_requested` and `tool_approval_resolved` are the events upstream Pi does not have,
// and they are the reason this extension is not simply the Pi one pointed at a different directory.
// They report a decision an operator was actually asked to make. Superopen refuses to synthesize an
// approval from a tool call -- a `tool_call` handler that blocks is an extension deciding, not an
// operator being asked -- so a runtime that reports real ones is a genuine capability gain.
//
// Deliberately absent: `mcp_notification`, which fires for every JSON-RPC notification a connected
// server sends, most of them routine tools/resources list refreshes. It describes MCP transport
// plumbing rather than an action the agent took. The MCP activity worth recording is the agent
// calling an MCP tool, which already arrives as a tool_call/tool_result pair.
