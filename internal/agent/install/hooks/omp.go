// Oh My Pi (`omp`) is integrated the same shape as Pi, which it forked: no hooks configuration file
// to merge into and no OpenTelemetry export, so the TypeScript extension API is the only
// observation surface. Superopen writes one extension file that forwards runtime events to the
// `so` binary, and managedExtension handles it exactly as it handles Pi's.
//
// The extension file itself is a separate source from Pi's rather than the same file installed
// twice. Oh My Pi exposes operator approval decisions and an operator Python surface that Pi does
// not, so the subscription lists genuinely differ, and each file carries its own marker so an
// install of one is never mistaken for an install of the other.

	// which runtime's extension it had found if either ever moved -- and an uninstall keyed on the
	// wrong marker removes the wrong file. Exported for the same three-package reason Pi's is.
	//
	// The version suffix is part of the contract with the extension source. Bump it when the
	// extension's behavior changes in a way that makes an older installed copy wrong, which is what
